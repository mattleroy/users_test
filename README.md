# users_test
Application that just handles user registration and authentication
Used Django, Django-crispy-forms
Allows users to register, login, logout, and redirect to an index page.

This is supposed to simulate a landing/index page for a website.
But because this is only supposed to be a registration/login application to plug into a website, I included nothing else but the navbar.
